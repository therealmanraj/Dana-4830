The data is limited because github does not allow more data to be hosted. To access the whole data put the year in the folder and it would extract all the data.

Files:

Extraction of data from csv for models.ipynb extracts the csv from the folders.

HVAC_Model.ipynb is for the HVAC prediction.

Occupancy_Model.ipynb is for the occupancy prediction.
